# Build a Blog with Rails 7

This project aims to familiarize myself with the latest features of Rails 7 and its useful tool libraries. I began by following the instructions outlined in the [Getting Started with Rails guide](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html) from the official Ruby on Rails documentation, then proceeded to integrate additional modules:

- Beautification using [Tailwind CSS](https://github.com/rails/tailwindcss-rails)
- Authentication using [Devise](https://github.com/heartcombo/devise)

## Development

Install the dependencies:
`bundle install`

Run the dev server:
`./bin/dev`

Run console:
`./bin/console`
